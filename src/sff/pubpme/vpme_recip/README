this stuff is the same as the pme_recip code except for a cray.
Note that some loops in charge_grid.f are exchanged versus the same
file in pme_recip: i.e. here the loop over atoms is the inner loop.
This code is much faster (145 mflops versus 23 mflops) on the YMP.
Thanks to Vance Shaffer of cray research for help wwith vector esoterica.

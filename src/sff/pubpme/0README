The tar file contains source code and data for doing Ewald and PME on
water boxes.  There is a huge pdb file of water, together with a filter
program to cut it into smaller boxes. (its best to test on small boxes
first, such as 3000 atoms or less. The exact code is very slow, i.e. 1 day
or more on big boxes such as 30000 atoms or more). Then there are programs to
compute "exact" ewald for accuracy tests, conventional ewald and
PME. The ewald sum consists of a direct sum, reciprocal sum, self energy
and an adjustment term. The latter is to correct for the fact that
atoms belonging to the same water molecule don't feel Coulomb forces,
but the reciprocal component of them are computed in the reciprocal sum.
The direct sum in these codes is very inefficient, since I was interested
here in PME, which is an approximation of the reciprocal sum. Besides,
the direct sum would now be computed the same way as normal nonbonds are
computed in MD programs, except the Coulombic pair interaction
	q_i.q_j/r_ij   becomes    q_i.q_j.erfc(beta.r_ij)/r_ij,
with a corresponding adjustment in force terms.

Some pieces of code are specific to water, since I wanted to be
independent of any force field (note however PME is in Amber4.1 and later)
The PME reciprocal code itself is general however, and should work for any
unit cell.

The code as is will definitely work on SGI's. I think HP's also.
If you have IBM there are a few minor problems that I recently helped
someone with, but I haven't put the fixes into the code yet.

Good Luck and e-mail me if you have problems,
